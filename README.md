# DL-Wine: Predicting Wine Quality from Weather Patterns
This repository contains a set of scripts and notebooks used to predict
wine quality from historical weather observations. Weather data from Météo‑Franc
e is merged with wine ratings scraped from Vivino to train deep learning models
capable of anticipating whether a vintage will be good given the year's climate.

## Repository Contents

- **Data collection and preprocessing** scripts
- **Deep learning models** for tabular data
- **Jupyter notebooks** for analysis and experimentation

 ---

 ## Installation

First install the Python dependencies:

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 The main packages used are `pandas`, `numpy`,`optuna`,`polars`,`plotly` and `torch`.

## Data Overview

### Weather
Weather observations are organised by French department and cover 1950–2
025. The raw and processed CSV/Parquet files can be found at:
[Météo France](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/donnees-climatologiques-de-base-quotidiennes/)
Weather observations are organised by French department and cover 1950–2
025. The raw and processed CSV/Parquet files are located in:

 ```
data/weather/
data/weather_by_year/
data/weather_by_year_cleaned/
```

### Wine
Wine ratings scraped from Vivino are stored in `data/Wine/`. The region
metadata is provided in `data/Wine/regions_corrected.csv`.
An interactive map of the wine regions can be found [here](docs/wine_map.html) !

## Quick Start

Load the datasets with `pandas`:

```
python
import pandas as pd

wine = pd.read_csv('data/out/vivino_wines_with_weather_AOC.csv')
weather = pd.read_parquet('data/weather_by_year/weather_all_stations_2010.parquet')

print(wine.head())
print(weather.head())
```

## Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

Generate weather features:

```bash
cd src/preprocessing/Weather
jupyter notebook features_weather.ipynb
```

Merge Wine and Weather data:

```bash
cd src/preprocessing/"Wine & Weather"
python build_wines_coord.py
```

### Model Training

Train and evaluate the predictive model:

```bash
cd src/model
python MLP.py
```
