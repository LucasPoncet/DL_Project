# DL_Wine: Predicting Wine Quality from Weather Data

This project leverages deep learning to predict wine quality based on historical meteorological data and wine ratings collected from Vivino. The objective is to provide predictive insights on whether a specific year's climatic conditions are favorable for producing high-quality wine.

## Data

### Weather Data

Weather data is sourced from Météo-France and organized by department:

- Historical data (1950-2023)
- Recent data (2024-2025)

Stored in:
```
data/weather/
data/weather_by_year/
data/weather_by_year_cleaned/
```

### Wine Data

Wine quality ratings scraped from Vivino:

- Raw data: `data/Wine/vivino_wines.csv`
- Regions metadata: `data/Wine/regions.csv`

## Quick Start

### Example: Loading Wine & Weather data

```python
import pandas as pd

wine_df = pd.read_csv('data/Wine/vivino_wines.csv')
weather_df = pd.read_parquet('data/weather_features/weather_features_33.parquet')

# Inspect datasets
print(wine_df.head())
print(weather_df.head())
```

## Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

Generate weather features:

```bash
cd src/preprocessing/Weather
jupyter notebook features_weather.ipynb
```

Merge Wine and Weather data:

```bash
cd src/preprocessing/"Wine & Weather"
jupyter notebook WQI.ipynb
```

### Model Training

Train and evaluate the predictive model:

```bash
cd src/model
python main_tabular.py
```
